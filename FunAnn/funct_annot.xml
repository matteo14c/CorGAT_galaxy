	**What it does?**
	
This program reads a tabular formatted file, in pseudo vcf format, as obtained from the **join_nucmer** utility and performs functional annotation of SARS-CoV-2 variants. Please notice that the program performs minimum error checks, and that it is designed to work exclusively with the reference annotation of the SARS-CoV-2 genome as available from Genbank. A copy of the genome in fasta format can be found also in this Galaxy, under Shared Data -> Data Libraries -> SARS-CoV-2-REF. 


The output file is again, a tabular file delineated by tabs, and providing different types of annotations for the variants included in the input file. A more detailed description of the output format can be found at : https://github.com/matteo14c/SARS-CoV-2_annot .
